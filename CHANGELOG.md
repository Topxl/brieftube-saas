FIX: Fix security advisor — remove SECURITY DEFINER from transcript_cost_analytics view
FIX: Fix security advisor — add SET search_path to generate_referral_code, pick_next_processing_job, prevent_sensitive_profile_changes
CHORE: Fix all RLS performance advisors — replace auth.uid() with (select auth.uid()) across 13 policies
CHORE: Add 6 missing FK indexes (channel_lists, list_follows, list_stars, profiles, referrals, subscriptions)
CHORE: Drop 2 unused indexes (idx_processed_videos_retry, idx_processed_videos_cost)
CHORE: Split list_channels "list owner write" ALL policy into INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE to eliminate multiple permissive SELECT policies
CHORE: Run code-quality CI on push to main (was pull_request only)
CHORE: Remove debug console.log from auth/callback route (production issue resolved)
FIX: Use NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL in OAuth redirectTo to avoid www vs non-www mismatch
FIX: Update prodUrl in site-config to https://www.brief-tube.com

CHORE: Delete apply_migration.py (one-off script that admitted it couldn't execute DDL)
REFACTOR: Remove summarize_with_retry() from gemini_api.py — dead code never called by main.py
REFACTOR: Remove video_url param from GeminiSummarizer.summarize() — was accepted but deliberately ignored; intent now documented in docstring
REFACTOR: Compile 14 regex patterns at module level in text_cleaner.py instead of per call
REFACTOR: Remove __main__ blocks from gemini_api.py, text_cleaner.py, whisper_transcriber.py
FIX: Move import time / import shutil to module level (were inline in hot paths / finally blocks)
FIX: Replace deprecated datetime.utcnow() with datetime.now(timezone.utc) in monitoring.py (×2)
FIX: Remove 3 dead config vars (COOKIES_FILE, BROWSER_PROFILE_DIR, YOUTUBE_PROXY_HTTPS) left over from deleted gemini_browser.py
REFACTOR: Consolidate Telegram alert logic — move MonitoringAlert and send_daily_report from monitoring.py to bot_handler.py; monitoring.py is now a pure data/stats module with zero Telegram dependencies
CHORE: Move 6 test_*.py scripts from worker root to worker/tests/ — add sys.path fix so they still run from the subdirectory
FIX: transcript_extractor.py missing `import re` at module level — _parse_vtt() silently failed (NameError swallowed by try/except), returning subtitle text with raw HTML tags to Gemini
FIX: _get_api() called once per language attempt (up to 12x per video) — now called once per get_transcript() call, reused across language loop
FIX: Bot() singleton in telegram_deliverer — was creating a new HTTPS connection pool on every delivery call
FIX: fail_job() now syncs processed_videos to "failed" when job permanently fails after 3 attempts — prevents videos staying stuck as "pending" forever
FIX: pick_next_job() now uses atomic PostgreSQL RPC with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED — eliminates race condition between rapid restarts or concurrent workers
FIX: import re and import aiohttp moved to module level in main.py (were inline in hot paths)
CHORE: delete gemini_browser.py (dead code, replaced by gemini_api.py)

FIX: RSS scanner loaded only 1000 of 4000+ known video IDs (PostgREST limit) — paginate get_all_known_video_ids() so the full set is always loaded; scanner no longer treats old videos as new
FIX: insert_new_video and enqueue_video upserts without ignore_duplicates overwrote skipped/completed videos back to pending — added ignore_duplicates=True to both

FIX: Worker Supabase HTTP/2 instability — disabled HTTP/2 in httpx client (h2 was installed, Supabase/Cloudflare sent GOAWAY frames causing constant ConnectionTerminated errors that blocked all deliveries since restart)
FIX: Worker multiple instances — two worker instances were running simultaneously causing race conditions; switched start/stop/restart scripts to use systemctl exclusively
CHORE: Worker systemd service — corrected path in brieftube-worker.service (Bureau/BriefTube → Bureau/Projets/BriefTube), changed Restart=always to Restart=on-failure, enabled and activated service

FIX: Scheduled/upcoming videos (Premieres) — RSS scanner now checks entry.published_parsed and skips videos with a future publish date; they're picked up naturally on the next scan once live; video_unavailable added to should_retry() so edge cases are retried instead of permanently failed

FIX: Video processing timeout — VIDEO_TIMEOUT (600s) was defined but never applied; wrap _process_video with asyncio.wait_for so a hung job can't block a semaphore slot forever

FIX: db.single() crash — mark_video_failed() and fail_job() used .single().execute() which throws if the row is missing (e.g. deleted between pick and fail); replaced with .execute() + explicit row check

FIX: Groq 429 permanently fails videos — should_retry() returned False for "whisper_error: 429" so videos hit Groq quota limit were marked failed permanently; now retries after midnight UTC quota reset

FIX: RSS scanner — was making 3375 individual DB queries per scan (225 channels × 15 videos × is_video_processed); replaced with a single get_all_known_video_ids() call that loads all IDs into a Python set; reduces Supabase load by 99% and eliminates Server disconnected errors during scans

FIX: Worker systemd services — brieftube-worker and brieftube-logbot now managed by systemd user services; guaranteed single instance, auto-restart on crash, starts at session login

FEATURE: SectionErrorBoundary — React class error boundary for dashboard sections; wraps SourcesSection and SummariesFeed so a section crash no longer blanks the full page
FEATURE: fetchApi + isApiError — typed fetch wrapper in src/lib/api-response.ts that throws on non-2xx or { error } bodies; unifies client-side API error handling
REFACTOR: resolveActionResult — now resolves ActionResult<T> discriminated union and throws on { error }; exports ActionResult, ActionSuccess, ActionFailure types
CHORE: Add type:supabase script to package.json — regenerate src/types/supabase.ts from local DB schema with one command

FIX: YouTube transcript IP block — configure WebshareProxyConfig (rotating residential) via YOUTUBE_PROXY_HTTP; uses native youtube-transcript-api WebshareProxyConfig with 10 auto-retries on block; transcripts now free again via YouTube API

FEATURE: yt-dlp subtitle fallback — 3-step transcript pipeline: (1) youtube-transcript-api, (2) yt-dlp VTT download with cookies/proxy (free, bypasses API IP block), (3) Groq Whisper; add deno to PATH at startup for yt-dlp JS runtime

FEATURE: E2E tests — auth redirects, onboarding wizard, dashboard channels (Playwright + Supabase magic link auth helper)

FEATURE: YouTube cookies support — place cookies/youtube.txt (Netscape format) to bypass IP blocks on transcript API; transcript_extractor auto-loads them if present; startup log indicates cookie status

FEATURE: Groq quota tracking — WorkerStats now tracks seconds/cost used today with daily reset; proactive Telegram alerts when IP is blocked (once/day), when quota reaches 80%, and when rate limit 429 is hit (with quota info)

FEATURE: Log bot Groq dashboard — Stats view now shows daily Groq cost, audio minutes, transcriptions, quota bar (🟢/🟡/🔴), rate limit hits, and IP block count parsed from worker.log

## 2026-02-19

CHORE: Best practices — env validation (required vars crash at startup), select specific columns on profiles, cancel_url → /dashboard/profile, SiteConfig template data cleaned, DB search_path hardened on 4 functions, processing_queue RLS policy added, transcript_cost_analytics SECURITY DEFINER removed


FIX: Transcript extractor — fallback "any language" call used no language spec, defaulting to English; French videos with FR transcripts were falling back to Whisper unnecessarily, burning Groq quota; now passes preferred_languages to the fallback call

FIX: Old videos backlog — cleared 2019 pending deliveries and 1933 queued jobs from pre-subscription era; deleted 3 orphan accounts (vj007@live.fr, vftg007@gmail.com, cholchaya2535@gmail.com) and their data via CASCADE

FEATURE: Referral system — referral_code on profiles, referrals table, 30-day cookie tracking, reward on Stripe checkout (20% monthly / 1 free month annual), ReferralSection on profile page, ShareListButton on list pages

FIX: Trial users can now upgrade to paid Pro — show upgrade button when isTrial even though isPro is true
FIX: Checkout preserves remaining trial days — passes trial_end to Stripe so user doesn't lose free days
FIX: DB — handle_new_user trigger changed from 14 days to 7 days trial
REFACTOR: Trial duration moved from DB trigger to SiteConfig.trialDays — change once in site-config.ts, applies everywhere
REFACTOR: SiteConfig.freeChannelsLimit aligned to 3 (was 5 on landing, 2 in DB trigger, 3 as DB default) — all ?? 3 magic numbers replaced
REFACTOR: SiteConfig.defaultTtsVoice added — replaces hardcoded "fr-FR-DeniseNeural" strings in code


REFACTOR: Log bot — remplace l'interface commandes/logs bruts par un dashboard interactif à boutons Telegram : menu principal avec statut worker (🟢/🟡/🔴), stats temps réel Supabase, erreurs reformatées, activité récente, système, et alertes live push (erreurs + succès toutes les 20s via bouton toggle)

FIX: Duplicate Telegram messages — if `send_photo` succeeded but `send_voice` failed, the fallback was sending the voice AGAIN as a separate message (user received photo + separate audio = 2 messages per video); now retries the voice as a reply to the existing photo instead, and returns True to prevent re-delivery next cycle if retry also fails

FIX: Duplicate deliveries on Supabase disconnect — if `mark_delivery_sent` threw after audio was already sent, the delivery stayed "pending" and was re-sent next cycle; now retries with reset_client up to 3 times before giving up

FIX: Duplicate Telegram deliveries — when linking a new account to Telegram, `start_command` now disconnects all other profiles that had the same chat_id before linking the new one; one Telegram = one account maximum

FIX: Delivery queue starvation — `get_pending_deliveries` fetched only the 10 oldest pending rows; if those had non-completed videos they blocked all deliveries forever; fix: fetch 5× more rows and stop after `limit` deliverable ones; also add `cleanup_undeliverable_deliveries()` called every 5 min to auto-discard deliveries for failed videos or disconnected users

FIX: Whisper transcription — support long videos (>50 min) by splitting audio into ≤20 MB chunks with ffmpeg, transcribing each chunk with Groq, then joining results; previously failed with "audio_file_too_large"

REFACTOR: Improve Telegram log bot readability — parse raw log lines into compact `HH:MM LEVEL  message` format with HTML bold/italic for errors/warnings; fix monitoring alerts that used Markdown v1 (`**bold**` was never rendering); switch all three files (log_bot.py, monitoring.py, bot_handler.py) to parse_mode=HTML

FIX: Remove email/password signup — /signup now redirects to /login; all "Start Free" buttons point to /login (Google OAuth only)


REFACTOR: Dashboard navigation — replace Billing nav item with Lists and Profile; update nav to show Dashboard, Lists, Profile; Desktop nav: logo + 3 links + plan badge + avatar circle linking to profile; remove email text and logout from header; move logout to Profile page

FEATURE: Dashboard Lists page — shows followed lists with inline unfollow action, created lists with channel count, and buttons to discover public lists or create new ones

FEATURE: Dashboard Profile page — unified profile section with account info (email, plan, session), Telegram/TTS voice delivery settings, and inline subscription management

FIX: YouTube bulk import — pre-mark all existing videos as "skipped" before inserting subscriptions so the RSS scanner never processes historical videos; only manually added channels trigger the latest-video delivery

FEATURE: Lists edit & delete — page /lists/[id]/edit avec modification nom/description/catégorie/chaînes, suppression de liste avec confirmation, et bouton "Import my subscriptions" sur la page de création pour pré-remplir depuis ses abonnements

FEATURE: Channel Lists — community-driven discovery feature with curated lists of YouTube channels; public discovery at /lists, list detail page, create page, star/follow actions, ghost subscription architecture (Pro/trial only), ListsSection in dashboard, and "Browse channel lists" link in onboarding wizard

FIX: Landing — replace all hardcoded "5 channels" with SiteConfig.freeChannelsLimit; FAQ price question now fetches real Stripe price instead of hardcoded "$9/month"


REFACTOR: Extract all hardcoded strings into locale system — created 4 locale files (landing, dashboard, auth) with 15+ components using centralized translations

## Previous

FIX: Worker Whisper fallback — fix critical bug where YouTube IP-block caused early return before Whisper was tried; fallback now always triggers correctly
